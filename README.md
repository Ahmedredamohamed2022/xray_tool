## An open-source script for trans., MC, and PVT analysis with process capability has been proposed.
* The script
  -   relies on open resources such as Xschem, Ngspice, SKYWATER PDK,and Python.
  -  acts as an X-ray device to analyze and manage your circuits’ test bench.
  -  assists the designer in checking the results within process capability indices.
  -  Save designer’s time and increase productivity time.
